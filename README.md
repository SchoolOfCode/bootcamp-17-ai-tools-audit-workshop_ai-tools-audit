**Techforge** needs your expertise to identify AI tools that can benefit the company. This is where you'll compile and share your full audit report, collaborating as a team to deliver insights that will shape Techforge's future!

## 📋 Here's What to Do:

1. **Create a new markdown file** for each AI tool that you evaluate. We suggest possibly using any of the five areas of evaluation mentioned in the task brief.
      A) Opportunity
      B) Risk
      C) Tangible Benefit
      D) Evaluation
      E) Compiling the Report
3. Discuss and **choose AI tools** as a team, and evaluate them across whichever key areas you feel is best suited.
4. **Collaborate** as a team to ensure your findings are thorough and cover all necessary aspects.
5. Once you're satisfied with your findings, **'Commit changes'** to the main branch of the repository.
6. Your team members can then **present your findings** individually or as a team based on the markdown reports.

### 🌟 What’s Next?

As you explore the different AI tools, remember this is a **collaborative effort**—each contribution builds the final audit report. Your task is not only to analyze the tools but to discuss and collaborate as a team, bringing the best insights forward.

### 🛠 Tools and Resources:
- **Markdown**: Use markdown to structure your reports clearly.
- **Git**: Commit your changes frequently to keep track of your progress.
- **Team Collaboration**: Work closely with your team to create a unified, strong report.
